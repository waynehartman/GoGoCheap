=========

Ya know, I do the same things on my iPhone as I do on iPad.  But some people have found that this should mean that they can charge you more. This is a simple little app to make your iPad look like an iPhone when signing up for in-flight GoGo WiFi.

Made this at 30,000 ft. flying from SAT to SLC.

Enjoy.
